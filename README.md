## Screenshots

**Home page** shows all products from the database, with pagination to limit the amount of products from the API response. Here user can use the Search Bar to search for any product by title, and go straight to its Product Single Page.

**Product Single** shows all the details of the products. By choosing a variant of size - color, user can see the amount of inventory left, and add them to the cart. Review feature, which is also being developed, is shown here as well.
![ProductSingle - Light](https://github.com/haidanglevn/fs16_Frontend-project/assets/24937536/512b5176-c0a1-40f8-a5ab-414afdf047bd)

**Cart Page**: Item in cart is seperated by variants, so two items of the same product, but different in variant will not be grouped together. User can clear the cart, change the quantity of the item (item with quantity 0 will be removed automatically) or click on Checkout to get to the CheckOut Page.

**CheckOut Page**: here user is required to login to proceed, as an order need the userId and addresses of the user. Here user have to choose one of the address as the shipping address, and a mock payment service. Then the Purchase button will be available to click, which complete the order creation process.

**Profile Page**: If user is already logged in, they can access profile page. The page currently has 3 tabs accessible from the left panel: Profile (default), Order (in the making) and Address. In **profile tab**, user can change its first, last name, password, email and avatar links. If password or email is changed successfully, user is prompted to login again.  At the bottom of the page is a button to logout of the current user (which clear out the access token stored in localStorage) and a button to access Admin Panel, which is only visible if the user role is Admin.

**Create A Product** page is a form for admin to create new product. Admin is required to have at least one image and one variant, in order to create a new product. Each product can have max 6 images, but unlimited amount of variant chosen by combination of colors and sizes, with a quantity from 1 to 300

The **order tab** is currently only showing all orders in the system. More functionalities is being added in the future.

Unfortunately, due to the limit of Material UI datagrid, Admin panel is not available for mobile screen size now, only for tablet and bigger.
